## Getting Started

"Be familiar with the google colab"

### Prerequisites
Before diving into this project, make sure you have the following essentials in place:

1.Google Colab: To access our implementation seamlessly in a cloud-based environment, ensure you have access to Google Colab.
2. Machine Learning (ML) Knowledge: Basic understanding of machine learning concepts will help you comprehend the project's algorithms and methodologies.
3.Python Proficiency: Familiarity with Python programming is a must, as our project is built using Python for seamless execution and easy code comprehension.


### Installation 

1. Open Google Colab: [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Click on **File** > **Upload Notebook** to upload the project's notebook.
3. Select the uploaded notebook from the file list and click **Open**.
4. Now, you can run the cells in the notebook to use the project.

## Usage
Find a Dataset: Search for authentication-related datasets on public repositories like Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, or other data repositories. Make sure to check the dataset's terms of use and licensing before using it.

Data Preprocessing: Once you have the dataset, preprocess it to handle missing values, normalize data, and split it into training and testing sets.

Train a Model: Use machine learning algorithms like SVM, Random Forest, or deep learning models like neural networks to train the authentication model on the training data.

Evaluate the Model: After training, test the model on the testing dataset to assess its performance. Common evaluation metrics for authentication tasks include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Authentication Result: Based on the model's performance on the test dataset, you'll get results indicating how well the authentication model is performing on unseen data.
